    Angular is a development platform, built on TypeScript. As a platform, Angular includes:
    A component-based framework for building scalable web applications.
    A collection of well-integrated libraries that cover a wide variety of features, including routing, forms management, client-server communication, and more.
    A suite of developer tools to help you develop, build, test, and update your code.

  <p-accordionTab header="Introduction">
      <p>
        Angular is a platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML 
        and TypeScript. Angular is written in TypeScript. It implements core and optional functionality 
        as a set of TypeScript libraries that you import into your applications.The architecture of an Angular 
        application relies on certain fundamental concepts. The basic building blocks of the Angular framework are Angular 
        components that are organized into NgModules. NgModules collect related code into functional sets; an Angular application is 
        defined by a set of NgModules. An application always has at least a root module that enables bootstrapping, and typically has many 
        more feature modules.
      </p>
  </p-accordionTab>
  <p-accordionTab header="Modules">
      <p>
        Angular NgModules differ from and complement JavaScript (ES2015) modules. An NgModule declares a compilation context for a set of components that is dedicated to an application domain, a workflow, or a closely related set of capabilities. An NgModule can associate its components with related code, such as services, to form functional units.

        Every Angular application has a root module, conventionally named AppModule, which provides the bootstrap mechanism that launches the application. An application typically contains many functional modules.
        
        Like JavaScript modules, NgModules can import functionality from other NgModules, and allow their own functionality to be exported and used by other NgModules. For example, to use the router service in your app, you import the Router NgModule.
        
        Organizing your code into distinct functional modules helps in managing development of complex applications, and in designing for reusability. In addition, this technique lets you take advantage of lazy-loading —that is, loading modules on demand— to minimize the amount of code that needs to be loaded at startup.
      </p>

  <p-accordionTab header="Components">
      <p>
        Every Angular application has at least one component, the root component that connects a component
         hierarchy with the page document object model (DOM). Each component defines a class that contains
         application data and logic, and is associated with an HTML template that defines a view to be displayed in a target environment.
      </p>
  </p-accordionTab>
  <p-accordionTab header="Routing">
    <p>
      The Angular Router NgModule provides a service that lets you define a navigation path among the different application states and view hierarchies in your application. It is modeled on the familiar browser navigation conventions:

      Enter a URL in the address bar and the browser navigates to a corresponding page
      Click links on the page and the browser navigates to a new page
      Click the browser's back and forward buttons and the browser navigates backward and forward through the history of pages you've seen
      The router maps URL-like paths to views instead of pages. When a user performs an action, such as clicking a link, that would load a new page in the browser, the router intercepts the browser's behavior, and shows or hides view hierarchies.
      
      If the router determines that the current application state requires particular functionality, and the module that defines it hasn't been loaded, the router can lazy-load the module on demand.
